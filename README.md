# Todo-list

It is a basic Todo list application created with the knowledge I have of HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and Express framework, to load it on the local server.
Ejs is also used to add dynamic content to HTML.

with the express basic function like use, get, and post, I created a local server and read data from FORMS in HTML, handled that data in the server, and displayed data in the form of a list.
